Linear Algebra is a study of vectors 

vectors are special objects that can be added together and
multiplied by scalars to produce another object of the same kind. From
an abstract mathematical viewpoint, any object that satisfies these two
properties can be considered a vector. 


Here are some examples of such
vector objects:
    
    1. Geometric vectors.
    2. Polynomials
    3. Audio signals
    4. Elements of Rn (tuples of n real numbers) are vectors.
    
Linear algebra focuses on the similarities between these vector concepts.
We can add them together and multiply them by scalars.
