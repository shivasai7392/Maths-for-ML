1. Find a particular solution to Ax = b.
2. Find all solutions to Ax = 0.
3. Combine the solutions from steps 1. and 2. to the general solution.


The system of linear equations in the preceding example was easy to
solve because the matrix in (2.38) has this particularly convenient form,
which allowed us to find the particular and the general solution by in-
spection. However, general equation systems are not of this simple form.
Fortunately, there exists a constructive algorithmic way of transforming
any system of linear equations into this particularly simple form: Gaussian
elimination. Key to Gaussian elimination are elementary transformations
of systems of linear equations, which transform the equation system into
a simple form. Then, we can apply the three steps to the simple form that
we just discussed in the context of the example in 


 Elementary Transformations

−2x1 + 4x2 − 2x3 − x4 + 4x5 = −3
4x1 − 8x2 + 3x3 − 3x4 + x5 = 2
x1 − 2x2 + x3 − x4 + x5 = 0
x1 − 2x2 − 3x4 + 4x5 = a

  is transformed to 
  
x1 − 2x2 + x3 − x4 + x5 = 0
x3 − x4 + 3x5 = −2
x4 − 2x5 = 1
0 = a +1


(Row-Echelon Form). A matrix is in row-echelon form if
All rows that contain only zeros are at the bottom of the matrix; corre-
spondingly, all rows that contain at least one nonzero element are on
top of rows that contain only zeros.

Looking at nonzero rows only, the first nonzero number from the left
(also called the pivot or the leading coefficient) is always strictly to the
right of the pivot of the row above it.


(Reduced Row Echelon Form). An equation system is in reduced
row-echelon form (also: row-reduced echelon form or row canonical form) if
It is in row-echelon form.
Every pivot is 1.
The pivot is the only nonzero entry in its column


(Gaussian Elimination). Gaussian elimination is an algorithm that
performs elementary transformations to bring a system of linear equations
into reduced row-echelon form.
