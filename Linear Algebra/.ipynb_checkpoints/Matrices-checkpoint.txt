Matrices play a central role in linear algebra. 


Definition 2.1 (Matrix). 
        With m, n ∈ N a real-valued (m, n) matrix A is
an m·n-tuple of elements aij , i = 1, . . . , m, j = 1, . . . , n, which is ordered
according to a rectangular scheme consisting of m rows and n columns:


Matrix Addition and Multiplication

add = add each element of same index

mul  = we multiply the elements of the ith row of A with the j th column of B and sum them up
 

Associativity:
    ∀A ∈ Rm×n , B ∈ Rn×p , C ∈ Rp×q : (AB)C = A(BC)
    
Distributivity:
    ∀A, B ∈ Rm×n , C, D ∈ Rn×p : (A + B)C = AC + BC
                                 A(C + D) = AC + AD

Multiplication with the identity matrix:
    ∀A ∈ Rm×n : I m A = AI n = A
    
Inverse and Transpose

(Inverse). Consider a square matrix A ∈ Rn×n . Let matrix
B ∈ Rn×n have the property that AB = I n = BA. B is called the
inverse of A and denoted by A−1.

                AB = I = BA.

(Transpose). For A ∈ Rm×n the matrix B ∈ Rn×m with
bij = aji is called the transpose of A. We write B = AT.
                                           
                                           (AT is Transpose of A)
                AA−1 = I = A−1A
               (AB)−1 = B−1 . A−1
               (A + B)−1 != A−1 + B−1
               (AT)T= A
               (A + B)T = AT + BT
               (AB)T = BT . AT
 
(Symmetric Matrix). A matrix A ∈ Rn×n is symmetric if A = AT.

 Multiplication by a Scalar

Associativity:
    (λψ)C = λ(ψC), C ∈ Rm×n
    
    λ(BC) = (λB)C = B(λC) = (BC)λ, B ∈ Rm×n , C ∈ Rn×k .
    
    Note that this allows us to move scalar values around.
    
    (λC)> = C > λ> = C >λ = λC > since λ = λ> for all λ ∈ R.
    
    
Distributivity:
    (λ + ψ)C = λC + ψC, C ∈ Rm×n
    
    λ(B + C) = λB + λC, B, C ∈ Rm×n
